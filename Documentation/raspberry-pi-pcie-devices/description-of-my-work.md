# Summary

For [this project](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices), I overhauled the documentation to add clarity and completely rewrite the repository's README from the ground up.

The new documentation is lively, modern, and full of all the necessary information in clear step-by-step format.
