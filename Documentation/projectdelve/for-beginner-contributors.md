# New to GitHub? Never fear, just start right here! 👍

This page will guide you through each part of the GitHub contribution workflow in order.  

# What is GitHub?
Put simply, GitHub is a platform where a lot of people host and build code-based projects collaboratively.

Put slightly less simply, GitHub is a website and cloud-based platform that lets developers store, manage, and collaborate on code, and since it's built around Git, it allows users to easily track + manage all changes to that code.

## Get familiar with GitHub *(optional, but recommended)*
If you want to follow GitHub's "Hello World" excercise that helps you get started with GitHub, you can find it [over here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).

If you'd like to follow GitHub's [Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart) flow, that's a fantastic option too!

You can also check out GitHub's glossary of common terms [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary).

# Make a GitHub account

1. Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).
2. Go to the top right-hand corner and click "Sign Up".
  - You should now see a welcome page that tells you `Welcome to GitHub! Let’s begin the adventure` and then prompts you to enter your email.
3. Enter your email and click "Continue".
4. Enter a password of your choosing and click "Continue".
5. Enter a username you would like to use and click "Continue".
6. Type either "y" or "n" to answer the question about getting emails.
7. Click "Continue".
8. You'll now need to solve a puzzle to verify your account. Once you've done so, click "Create account".
9. You should now see a screen with six number input boxes on it asking you for a `launch code`.
  - Go to the email inbox for the email you used to create your account
  - Find the email from GitHub
  - Type the code it gave you into the page that is asking for it
10. GitHub will now take you through a series of questions for personalization, or you can skip this step by clicking "Skip personalization" down towards the bottom of your screen.
11. GitHub will initialize your dashboard and drop you back your new home screen.
12. 🎉 **Success!** 🎉 Congrats on setting up your new GitHub account. You're already doing great!

# OPTIONAL: Install GitHub Desktop

If you don't want to use the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) to communicate between your computer and GitHub, you can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) as an easy solution instead.

> Focus on what matters instead of fighting with Git. Whether you're new to Git or a seasoned user, GitHub Desktop simplifies your development workflow.

*Read more about GitHub Desktop in its documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop).*

🌟 GitHub Desktop also has the advantage of being already integrated with [Atom](https://atom.io/), so if Atom is your preferred code editor, you're in luck!

# Fork a repository

The first step to contributing to anyone else's repository on GitHub is [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks). To learn to fork a repository, follow the steps in GitHub's documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

To fork the **Project Delve repository** specifically, you can simply [click here](https://github.com/punnypenguins/projectdelve/fork).

# Clone a repository to you computer

When you're on GitHub.com looking at a repository, what you're seeing is a cloud-based repository. GitHub calls this `remote`, a term you'll see pop up a lot if you use GitHub desktop.

To work on a GitHub repository locally on your own computer, you need to first do something called **cloning**. You can read about cloning and find instructions on doing it in GitHub's documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

If you're using the command line, you can copy-paste the cloning command for a specific repository via the dropdown menu under that repository's green `Code` button. If you're using GitHub Desktop, select the option that says `Open with GitHub Desktop` (this will take you to GitHub Desktop and start the process to create a copy of repository on your device) from the same dropdown menu.

# The GitHub flow

You can do all the parts of this process via GitHub Desktop, the command line, or the website's interface. This is a workflow that you'll generally be expected to use for any GitHub repository you contribute to.

So, you want to edit or add to someone else's repository. You've already **forked** the repository, creating a new, connected duplicate under your own profile. Now it's time to create a **branch** from that duplicate, make some changes, "push" the changes, and submit a **pull request** once you're ready for your changes to be merged with the original repository someone else owns.

## 1. Create a new branch

Learn about branches [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches).

Learn to **create a branch** [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).

## 2. Create or edit a file

You can do this any way that you normally prefer to create new files that you're going to work with. My personal go-to is to open a repository's files in Atom and create a new file via right clicking, but everyone has their own preference. Pick a method and create a new file, or open a file that already exists and start adding/editing away.

## 3. Push changes to GitHub 

Learn about pushing changes to GitHub [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/pushing-changes-to-github).

## 4. Submit a pull request

Learn about pull requests [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

Learn how to **create a pull request** [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## Success!

🎉 **You did it!** 🎉 Congrats on learning how to use GitHub and submitting your first pull request. You're on your way to being a pro!
