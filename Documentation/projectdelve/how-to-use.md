Project Delve is nice and simple. All content is viewable from one single menu, so you can't get lost.

## Sidebar/Menu Sections

If you're using a desktop computer, you will see a **blue sidebar** on the left side of your screen. If you're on mobile, this sidebar will be tucked into a drop-down menu, which you can find by clicking the symbol with **three horizontal lines** in the top left corner of your device's screen. In each case, you will see that the menu holds a list of several topics.

These items are the website's **main categories**, which are:
- About
  - Contains the "About" page, how to contribute to Project Delve, and the sources I pulled all these projects from.
- Distributed Computing Projects
- Historical Projects
- Humanities Projects
- Online Scientific Projects
- Outdoor Scientific Projects
- Project Hub Websites
  - Contains entries for websites that are not projects *themselves* but instead host or link to many projects. Some are simply project lists, and some are project hubs that you can log into.

All you need to do to find projects is click the section you're interested and then start scrolling through the list of projects you'll see there.

## The Tag System

As you navigate this site, you'll notice that every project page has some near the top. These are clickable as well, and will take you to a page that lists every single website entry that contains that tag. There are **main tags** for all of the major categories *(distributed computing, history, humanities, science),* **location tags** *(specifying whether a project can be done on devices or must be done outside),* and **specialty tags** *(which cover major subject matter and assorted academic fields—some examples would be "new zealand history", "ornithology", and "linguistics").*

All are clickable, all will take you to relevant subject matter.

## The Search Bar

And, of course, you always have access to the tried and true **search bar** in the sidebar as well. It works like—well. You know. Every other search bar. If you suddenly find that it DOESN'T, please, by all means, click on over to the "Contributing" page under "About" and shoot me an email to let me know!
