# Contributing to Project Delve

Project Delve welcomes file edits, new project additions, and new site features from anyone who wants to contribute.

There are two paths to choose between if you plan to contribute...
* ...and you're **new to GitHub** - Pause here. Go follow the guide I created [**specially for beginners**](https://github.com/punnypenguins/projectdelve/blob/main/documentation/for-beginner-contributers.md) to walk you through everything.
* ...and you **already know GitHub's workflow** - Continue on to the following sections of this doc.

# Style Guidelines
