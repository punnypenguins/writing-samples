# Contributing to Project Delve

Write something nice and instructive as an intro. Talk about what kind of contributions you are interested in.

There are two paths to choose between if you plan to contribute:
* **New to GitHub** - Pause here. Go follow the guide I created [**here**](https://github.com/punnypenguins/projectdelve/blob/main/documentation/for-beginner-contributers.md) to walk you through everything.
* **Already know GitHub's workflow** - Continue on to the following sections of this doc.

### Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you've met the following requirements:

* You have a GitHub [account](https://github.com/join)
* You have [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) set up
* You have forked and cloned the [projectdelve repository](https://github.com/punnypenguins/projectdelve)
* You know how to create a [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)
* You know how to create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

## Suggesting a project or other addition

### Style Guidelines

This project is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), and its front matter formatting follows [Hugo's](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) syntax.

### Review process

Once your pull request is submitted, I'll review it within a week and request changes if necessary. Once I confirm everything is good to go, your pull request will be accepted and merged with the master branch.

## Additional resources

Include links to additional resources, such as docs, bugs, and communication venues (developer listserv, emails, etc).
