# Moss is the coolest and I will die on this hill, thanks

OKAY. SO. There are two main types of plants on our planet at this point within the plant kingdom (_Plantae_)—seed-bearing plants and non-seed-bearing plants. But plants are obviously more complicated than _that_, so we sub-divide them based on other important differences, like whether they have vascular structures (essentially tubes like our human blood vessels) or not.

MOST plants are in the "with seeds" group—flowers, weeds, pretty much all trees. Most of the plants we see in our daily lives are part of this group. They can have just flower blooms, they can have coniferous seed dispersal systems, they can have fruits or berries that we eat. There's a lot of variety, lol.

Mosses, though, are part of the less-common, much more ancient batch of plants. They don't have seeds, and don't produce any type of fruit or blossom. Moss, algae, ferns, and liverworts are the only plants in this category. (for our purposes, so this doesn't become seven pages long lol, I'll just talk about mosses only haha)

Instead of using seed dispersal, mosses reproduce by releasing spores into their environment. Here's where it gets interesting!

Plants evolved to be more and more complex over time, and it was the development of vascular (fluid/etc. vessels) structures that let them grow super tall and become things like grasses, wildflowers, bushes, and trees! They can grow tall because they're able to move water and nutrients from the lower parts up much higher. Mosses can't do this; they don't have vascular structures. So they stay very short.

Plants have two phases that they cycle between in their life cycle—diploid (sporophyte stage) and haploid (gametophyte stage). Gametophytes have **ONLY ONE** set of DNA per cell. Sporophytes have **TWO** sets of DNA per cell.

Plants like trees spend their whole lives in the sporophyte stage, and occasionally produce gametophyte parts for reproduction (pollen and stuff, which become diploid seeds.)

But plants like mosses live their whole lives in the GAMETOPHYTE stage, not the sporophyte stage. They only have it temporarily during their little reproduction periods. So while a tree, yard flower, or bush is constantly in its most complex cellular state every time we see it, mosses are mostly not.

So when you see a patch of moss with the little strands sticking up out of it with spore pods on the ends, you're catching a very exciting and infrequent moment where they've built an entirely different moss structure becauase it was the right condition/time for it to reproduce! The sporophyte heads and "sticks" will be gone not long after.

Mosses and liverworts were the first-ever plants to grow on land, so they had to do the best they could with a very restricted setup. Plants like our modern ferns were the stepping-stone between mosses/liverworts and our modern plants! They still use spores, like mosses, but they developed vascular structures so they can get much taller and leafier like "real" plants! It's so cool. Mosses are the precursor structure for all other plant life on earth, and still are around today for us to see and appreciate how different they are!

I go ham, personally, and take pictures any time I see moss in its sporophyte stage. And the sporophyte stage structures can look really different too—some are tan colored, some are bright red, some are very short, some get a few inches tall, some look like swan heads, some are almost perfect spheres—it's magical!
