## FIRST: Virus Transmission Vectors

Viruses are all over our planet, everywhere, all the time. Some are transmitted through air, some through bodily fluids, etc. etc. A very, very important distinction to know is what scientists and doctors mean when they talk about a virus being transmitted through airborne movement. Being truly airborne indicates that a particular virus, which in the airborne stage is dried out and floating, can move through air for an impressive amount of time and get breathed in by anyone in the wrong place at the wrong time. A few of the more well-known airpron transmission viruses include chicken pox, measles, and hantavirus. 

Airborne transmission SORT OF includes viruses like the influenza family, because you CAN catch them via breathing in contaminated air. But it's not QUITE a true airborne situation. Rather than being dried out, influenza particles get transmitted through, say, microscopic sneeze droplets in the air, which have limited hang time and a limited radius of travel, and the virus particles themselves don’t just float around lightly enough in dry air to travel wherever. So they’re airborne, but like, pseudo-airborne.

After that, you get into the SOLIDLY only-various-bodily-fluids viruses, which include things like HIV—someone with a significantly advanced HIV infection could like, spit in your food, and sneeze in your face, and you’re still not going to get it, because it’s only transmitted through blood/semen/vaginal fluid/breast milk. Not sweat. Not spit. Etc.

Then you get to things like Ebola. And Ebola is REALLY BAD, because 1) it’s highly infectious and we have very little resistance to it as a species, and 2) it’s spread via blood, but the way Ebola affects the body, people tend to projectile vomit, bleed all over, have massive diarrhea and generally hemorrhage in every way possible, which means blood and blood-tainted bodily fluids get EVERYWHERE. Ebola also spreads much more readily than something like HIV; it travels through blood, urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, etc. etc., AND anything they touch. There are millions of particles of virus in a heavily infected person’s single drop of blood, and it only takes, like, 1-5 to infect someone else. You can see the problem. The ONLY saving grace is that people can’t transmit the virus during the incubation period—it only starts transmitting once they get the first symptoms, which generally are a headache and exhaustion.

Virus transmission is generally “horizontal” which just means that it’s between individuals in the at-risk population. There are several modes possible:
* **direct contact** transmission (a person touches an infected person or contaminated object directly themselves)
* **common vehicle** transmission (contaminated water supply, contaminated food supply, very often creates epidemic because—what are people going to do about it?? stop drinking water from their only water source???)
* **airborne** transmission (as mentioned above, these are generally respiratory infections, but regardless, you either breathe them in or touch something that they’ve landed on)
* **vector-borne** transmission (mosquitos, ticks, flies, etc.—things that are carriers and bite you. also rabies, but that’s usually a full animal biting you)
* **iatrogenic** transmission (health care workers, essentially—their receiving or spreading of the virus. Veterinarians, nurses, dentists, etc.)
* **transplacental** transmission (several possible ways a virus passes from mother to baby while the mother is pregnant. a lot of the more serious viruses cause birth defects or straight up kill the baby—think rubella, Zika, Lassa, Ebola)

So those are modes of transmission. Cool. Different viruses get passed between people in different ways, and some are more or less dangerous than others. You’re not really gonna die from a cold virus, but Lassa could do you in. Some things infect you in a day, while others take years to decades. Shit’s wild. Now let’s talk a little about Ebola.

## A SHORT HISTORY OF EBOLA:

Ebola is a very, very, very bad virus. Or rather, it’s fantastic at *being* a virus, and horrible news for humans.

There are several levels of viruses in the biosafety classification system. They range from Level 1 (eh, whatever) to Level 4 (kill bill sirens). Level 4 viruses require not just safety gloves and proper lab attire, but full spacesuit gear with pressurized rooms, double and triple gloving, personal oxygen supplies, decontamination showers, etc. etc. These are the viruses that can wipe out villages, towns, cities, two-thirds of the human population. These are the viruses that are death sentences. These are the viruses where if you poke a needle through all three of your gloves, or find an invisible leak in your under-layer glove, you pick a god and pray. And then you usually die, some days or weeks later, in the quarantine area of whatever facility you used to work for.

Marburg, Ebola, Lassa, Nipah, hantavirus, and smallpox are all Level 4 pathogens.

So. Ebola. It's existed for a long, long time, who knows how long. It’s old. It’s been chillin, out in nature, a common virus for some animal species we haven’t pinpointed yet, despite efforts and expeditions over the years. Probably bats. Possibly. We don’t know, but it seems like maybe bats. Never on our radar.

Then: it’s 1976. In a village along the Ebola River in Central Africa, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo and used to be called Zaire, the virus made a jump. This was the first microbreak, the indicator of a virus trying to crash into a new species. The hallmark of a future epidemic. One person was infected with a virus no one had seen before. It wasn’t Marburg. It wasn’t Lassa fever. It was similar, but not the same. It was worse. The virus infected like wildfire for a short period of time before seeming to vanish again as suddenly as it came.

This was Ebola Zaire, erupting in 55 villages along the river before the end of that microbreak, and it killed nine out of every ten people infected. This is now what is simply called Ebola virus, and continues to be the most deadly strain of human Ebola that has so far mutated into existence and remained in circulation.

500 miles away, in south Sudan, a separate strain of Ebola emerged and wreaked some havoc before also dying down. These were our first brushes with it. The warning shots fired over the bow. But then it vanished, and aside from some research being done, the world didn’t worry. Things didn’t escalate too much until the 2014-2016 virus outbreak exploded over in Africa, spreading out from Guinea, and put the virus on the world stage in a matter of weeks.

Ebola is simple. You get contaminated, you get sick. No one is resistant to it, because it’s too new. Ebola attacks every tissue in the human body except bone and skeletal muscle. The virus particles invade every cell and take them over for their own manufacturing purposes until tissue dissolves into nothing but bloody soup. Almost every part of the body becomes a slime of virus particles and highly, highly infectious blood. Once you are symptomatic, you have a week or less. If you make it to day 7-10 without dying, there’s a good chance you’ll turn the corner and recover. Otherwise…it’s game over. Ebola progresses from a pounding headache and general illness-malaise quite rapidly to heavily vomiting blood and tissue. The downhill decline from there is dramatic, and I’m not gonna go into detail, but it’s extremely messy and extremely bad. Your body is being liquefied by a virus, that’s never going to go well. But a very small amount of people do live and recover, so there’s always hope. *(AND ALSO THERE’RE SOME REALLY AMAZING DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED STARTING WITH ZMAPP THAT ARE REVOLUTIONIZING AREAS OF MEDICINE AND I’LL YELL ABOUT THAT TOO SOMETIME IF YOU WANT, THEY ARE INCREDIBLE AND MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR EBOLA TREATMENT AND CANCER AND STUFF)*

ANYWAY.

Ebola was finally mostly wrestled under control more or less after the terrifying and deadly epidemic a few years ago. For now. The world is not currently in an epidemic panic, so that’s a win. We’ve made a lot of headway. But Ebola is still very dangerous and often fatal, and highly highly infectious, and if it gets opportunities to mutate, it can and will. And THAT’S where things get really interesting.

Let’s explore cross-species transmission with monkeys and the United States military.

## EBOLA RESTON, A PRIME(ATE) EXAMPLE OF CROSS-SPECIES JUMPS INCREASING LETHALITY AND CHANGING VIRUS CHARACTER (I know the pun was terrible, I’ll show myself out):

At 1946 Isaac Newton Square in Reston, VA, there is currently a Kindercare. But back in 1989, Hazelton Research Products had a quarantine station there for incoming monkeys before they were shipped out to labs for research purposes around the United States. And it was about to go hotter than the surface of the Sun, biologically speaking.

Some monkeys were imported from the Phillipines. That wasn’t unusual. They were/got sick. Also not totally unusual. They all. Every one of them. Died.

That? Unusual. To say the *least*.

And then monkeys in another room got sick, very sick, and started to die. Ebola was new, and not on anyone’s radar, and besides. These were monkeys from a different part of the world. They weren’t from Africa. But the situation was rapidly spiraling out of control, and the man in charge finally reached out to USAMRID (basically, the “we deal with all the godawful disease and death viruses and bacteria pathogens so we hopefully avert a biological catastrophe some day” part of the US Military, working on and off in tandem with the CDC but with different missions and objectives). To everyone’s surprise and abject horror, tissue sampled from the monkeys came up positive for Ebola, of all things, and suddenly the US was potentially about to face an epidemic. Poor 27-year-old new intern Tom had to explain THAT one to his superiors, and the gears of controlled panic were set in motion and the situation was turned over to the Army and CDC and handled rapidly.

Except. Except. The monkeys were all infected, the house was a hotbed for a Level 4 virus, the situation-handling and clean-up lasted weeks and months, but no one got sick.

If I remember correctly, two of the workers at the house were actually infected. The virus showed up in their blood tests. But it never made them sick. Ebola! EBOLA! It didn’t make them sick! Now. We don’t know if perhaps when you infect 1000 humans with Ebola Reston, 60 WOULD get sick to some extent. Maybe they would, maybe they wouldn’t, maybe it would be 800 out of 1000 or 1 or none at all. Regardless, this was another new strain of Ebola, capable of getting INTO humans but clearly not the deadly mess that is Ebola Zaire. But for the MONKEYS. Oh, for the monkeys. It was a death sentence for the monkeys even MORE than Ebola Zaire is for us.

So what gives?

When a virus makes a cross-species jump, there are usually a few things that hold true. One is that the virus has now permanently altered enough that the new strain doesn’t turn back around and re-jump into the old host. It doesn’t need or want to. It’s got a whole new playing field now, and it’s going to continue to mutate to take advantage of its new host species where there is much, much tastier fruit. Another is that it is often much, much more serious and severe in the new species than it was in the old. This can be because of how it infects them—some organisms are just more vulnerable to respiratory attacks, or nervous system damage, etc. etc., but is mostly because the new species has absolutely no resistance to the virus. It’s new. It’s strange. Nothing in the new species’ DNA offers any real benefit in fighting the virus, because there’s been no time for natural selection to help those best suited to fight it off survive. There wasn’t a pruning like with the Black Death. So when SARS, or the bird flu, or Ebola pops up, humans get hit hard.

But what about Ebola Reston? The blood from the monkeys in Reston were tested against three known blood serums:
1. **Musoke** (to indicate the Marburg virus)
2. **Boniface** (to indicate Ebola Sudan strain)
3. **Mayinga** (to indicate the Ebola Zaire strain)

And which one do you bet the monkeys turned up positive for?

Ebola Zaire. The most deadly-to-humans mutation known to us to this very day. The grim reaper. A highly infectious nuclear bomb of a virus, miles away from Washington, D.C., sweeping through a primate house.

But it wasn’t exactly Ebola Zaire. The virus had mutated again. And this time, it was for the monkey species it was running through like wildfire. The proteins had mutated in just the right way to make Ebola fall in love with primates and out of love with humans.

And this is where we see Ebola Reston being a textbook example of the important effects of cross-species jumps. It 1) is EXTREMELY infectious to the new species it has moved into, as evidenced by the fact that ALL THE MONKEYS in the house ended up getting it even while stuck in cages in entirely separate (and blocked off, after a while) rooms, not to mention being extremely lethal to boot, and 2) affects a  species that previously hosted it in a COMPLETELY different way. In this case, the species is humans, and “a COMPLETELY different way” is “out of all the animal-handling people who have tested positive for this particular Ebola strain, one person got a mild flu-like illness and that’s it, instead of, you know, liquefying to death.”

The monkeys were 100% vulnerable to Ebola Reston. Whatever they got it from, over in the Philippines, and however it had gotten over TO the Philippines, in the monkeys it was now something entirely new. For safety, Ebola Reston is still classified as a Level 4 pathogen and handled as such, because no one wants to be the person to say “nah it’s fine!” and then have some poor farm hand or lab intern die because of it. And despite having changed, it IS still Ebola, and it takes very little mutation to potentially make it deadly for humans again. So we treat it carefully. It showed up in pigs, too, more recently, and that is a worrying development, because from livestock to humans, it’s not a big virus jump. We may well see Ebola Reston circle back around someday, although boy do I sure hope not!

Anyway. What was horrible news for the poor monkeys was great news for us, because hey, guess what guys! We narrowly averted a global Ebola pandemic by the skin of our teeth, the good decisions of USAMRID top officers, and the pure chance of small mutations making a virus suddenly go from deadly to humans to “eh, not really a problem”. We got LUCKY. Extremely lucky. That was a bullet the size of the Moon that we dodged back in 1989.

Reston is 35 minutes away from Washington, D.C. by ye average American car.

Ultimately, there’s no predicting what Ebola is going to do next, or whether a new strain is going to crop up that’s even worse than Ebola Zaire (which is now called just the Ebola virus, and thought of as the main one for humans). We can only keep our fingers crossed, our research and drug development hopping, and a careful, careful watch on the little flares of Ebola that cross to humanity from wild animals every so often. If Ebola does mutate, which it will continue to do so long as it actively infects living organisms—epidemics of emerging viruses are extra dangerous partly because of the fact that more infected hosts equals more virus replication equals more DNA or RNA decoding and re-coding equals more chances for mutation equals more mutations that can make the virus even better at taking over a host and surviving long enough to spread and infect more—we can only hope for all our sakes that it will be a situation like the Reston monkeys, if it has to happen at all.
