#A quick primer on HIV and how it really works (because it’s terrible and cool and I wanted to yell about yet another virus)

So!!! HIV! One of the single most vilified viruses in modern history, subject of SO much misinformation (along with AIDS) and fearmongering and hatred and the topic of many, many arguments over the past few decades. Let’s get to the bottom of what it really is, shall we?

It’s actually SO interesting and intense that most bio textbooks use it as THE case study virus for Here’s Why Viruses are Bad and Really Fuckin Hard To Make Vaccines For A Lot of the Time.

So. Let’s take this from the top. Once you get infected somehow with HIV, the virus either does or does not make your immune system panic to the extent that you get what feels like *maybe* a flu. And then that’s it.

Except it’s NOT.

Normally when we get a virus, we *maybe* feel sick, or *maybe* we don’t. Regardless, our immune system screams **HOLY INVADERS, BATMAN** and goes nuts fighting whatever virus it is with all the rad immune cells, and then we’re left with antibodies for that particular virus strain for the rest of our lives, and if we catch it again, or if the remnant in our bloodstream starts trying to multiply again, our bodies go _**NOT TODAY SATAN, YAHHHHHH**_ and whack-a-moles it before we can even notice anything is wrong. (Shingles, for example, is what happens when chicken pox is like HA HA!!!! YOU THOUGHT I WAS GONE, BUT I AM NOT!!!!!!! *DIE!!!!!!* and our bodies are like **YOU** AGAIN????? UGH. no. STOP. *denied.* and fights it off with help from medicine, because *heyo,* the chicken pox virus is Really Bad News when you’re an adult, and loves doing fast and HARD attacks on things like eyes. And skin. which are. you know. really important. We like not being blind.)

With most viruses, our body has a multi-angle approach that stops them. We’ve got all *kinds* of cells that do all kinds of *things,* halting viruses or *eating* viruses or cleaning up damage or blocking their paths to healthy cells—etc. etc. etc.

But HIV is Extra Bad, because when HIV hits our bloodstream, it’s Extra Sneaky And Smart and literally goes “lmao you need this protein here? to keep me from attacking stuff? haha TOO BAD I’m going to disable ALL OF THEM. CHECKMATE.”

It. disables the protein. whose JOB is LITERALLY to specifically stop viruses and keep them from multiplying. So it just…breaks the whole jail system and replicates like mad. It’s like the horse firing the horse-catcher.

The HIV virus then spends years and years constantly replicating and multiplying and attacking various parts of our immune system and destroying it systematically. And to add insult to injury, much of the HIV replication is done IN immune system T cells. That’s. *So* rude.

For a while, the viral load (amount of virus in our bodies) and T cell count (amount of super important immune cells) stays fairly even, after several months of infection and up to years and years later. HIV *mostly* chills out and just infects opportunistically without working much.

But over time, it starts wrecking the rest of the immune system T cells and stuff, and it tips the balance, and our bodies start to have a hard time fighting off *any* infections anymore, because most of the immune system is simply GONE. And *that’s* when people get diagnosed with Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome—AIDS.

All AIDS means is “your body is mcfreaking SHIT at fighting any invaders off anymore, and eventually, even the mildest cold could literally kill you.”

We can’t get rid of HIV completely from a host’s body, once a person is infected, but we CAN keep it from leading to the immune system compromising disaster mess of AIDS IF the patient keeps up their regimen of antiretrovirals permanently and consistently. This is why it’s so critical that the medicines be financially and geographically accessible—people WILL die without them. It’s not a “maybe”, it’s a when.

I can yell about virus mutation rates, too, if you want, bc that’s literally the neatest way to learn about vaccines and why they’re SO hard for things like HIV and the common cold and flus.

**Tl;dr:** HIV may or may not make you FEEL sick *once,* but then it Doesn’t Go Away, it just casually hacks and destroys your entire immune system so you can’t even *try* to fight it anymore. **So it just…lives. like a permanent home invader. That slowly and inexorably disassembles your entire security system via the electric system, starting with the breaker box. And then it cheerfully allows every looter and burglar who wants to come in to just wander in and burn down the rest of the house for fun.**
