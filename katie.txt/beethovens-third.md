listen?!!!!!! anything that can make me go BUCKWILD and HEADBANG in my car at 5:30 in the morning when the highway is not a place it’s an emotion is on a DIFFERENT LEVEL, this shit made me SHOUT OUT LOUD WITH SHEER EMOTION IN FRONT OF GOD AND THE CROSS COUNTRY TRUCKERS WATCHING ME DIRECT A SYMPHONY WITH HALF A PANCAKE IN MY HAND, this shit SLAPS, BEETHOVEN’S THIRD COULD **NEVER** 

“But it’s so beautiful Katie!! It’s the first symphony that truly shows Beethoven coming into his own full dramatic range as an innovative composer, Katie, it’s an iconic symphony of history, you can’t just ignore the 3rd Katie” first off, I’m not ignoring anything, the 3rd is great I like it too, I’M JUST SAYING THE 7TH MAKES ME LOSE MY FUCKING MIND, CHERYL,
