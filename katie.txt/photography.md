## How to take pictures:

1. Possess a magpie in your brain that screams with delight any time it spots bright/shiny objects (and moss).

2. Have no impulse control, so just duck, crawl, jump, slither, crouch, climb, and generally scramble around however necessary to get cool angles with lots of color and the right focus.

3. Take several photos. Then spot new angles and lighting and take more from there.

4. Play with levels in an editor so the photo's colors and lighting look vivid + rich like you see them in your heart, instead being dimmed and flatenned of like the disappointing facsimile they currently are.

5. Once satisfied, save your bright/shiny objects (and moss) photos and then share them on your favorite platforms with extreme magpie joy.

6. Profit???
