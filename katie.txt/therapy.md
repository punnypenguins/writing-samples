therapist: how do you spell “no”

me: [literally goes deer in the headlights and can’t make eye contact while panicking for over ten seconds of silence while I try to figure out what the correct response is because I am PANICKING]

therapist, apparently reading my ducking mind: this isn’t a trick question

me, shakily, asking as a question: n…o…?

therapist: almost. you forgot one thing. you spell it “n”, “o”, “period”.
