I wonder if [Curiosity](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/) knows how much we love it. We make sure it gets to hear happy birthday every year but does it know how much we love it, how grateful we are of it, how proud we are, SO proud, how we’ve cried for it and laughed because of it and how much awe and wonder and excitement we’ve felt because of its small little self and all it’s done? Does Curiosity know?
