tbh I don’t understand why people tend to take the nit-picking-precision science students and scientists have for experiments and stuff and think that it’s the same for every other aspect of our lives, like we’re precise and neat and clean and have neat notes and well-arranged materials and stuff. because like. buddy. my guy.

as far as I’ve ever seen, we’re all much more likely to be running around screaming and barely keeping a grip on eight-billion-and-one notebooks we have and like seventy tabs of information and sixteen homework sets and eight books while dying in front of a whiteboard and throwing our calculator at the nearest hard object. Also just having pens e v e r y w h e r e.

our work is organized but our lives sure as hell ain’t
