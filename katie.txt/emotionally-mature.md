last night I accidentally deleted over 300 pages of typed up files for a website I’ve been building and emptied the trash before I realized I’d deleted the wrong folders and hadn’t backed it up since my computer got bricked a few days ago and I had to wipe the drive and restore it to factory settings. however instead of flying off an emotional cliff I just stood in shock for about forty seconds, then stood in deeply sad dismay for about twenty, and then I just created a new website folder via command line and got back to work, reasoning that there’s no way to change it so I’ll just move forward making it more efficient and well-written than the first version. and THAT is called self growth and emotional progress
