# Distributed Computing Projects

This section has all active volunteer [**distributed computing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) projects, which ask people to volunteer some of their computers' background processing power for researchers to use in their efforts to crunch massive data sets, run mathematical simulations, and perform other computations.

**NOTE:** Many of these projects are built with BOINC, which has certain system requirements for the devices it can run on. To see if your device meets them, you can check the specifications [here](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/System_requirements).

### Learn about distributed Computing
- A hideously ugly but still solid [page](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2001-02/distributed-computing/html/what_is_it_.html) on it from a 2001 Stanford computer science course
- Solid and detailed [summary](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/distributed-computing) from Science Direct (available for PDF download AND automatic adding to Mendeley!)
- [Detailed guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/txseries/8.1.0?topic=overview-what-is-distributed-computing) from IBM
