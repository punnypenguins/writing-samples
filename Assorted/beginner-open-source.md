# Open source - helpful resources for beginners

First, open source in general:

*   Digital Ocean has a great, easy-to-read tutorial series [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source) that's a really helpful introduction to GitHub and to open source projects overall
*   There's a great in-depth video [here](https://getinvolved.hanselman.com/) that covers a lot about how to get involved in the great big community of developers in different ways 
*   [This article](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/get-involved-in-open-source-today-how-to-contribute-a-patch-to-a-github-hosted-open-source-project-like-code-52) is from 2012 but it's still a nice and encouraging primer for getting started with open source
*   HackerEarth has a good [page](https://www.hackerearth.com/getstarted-opensource/) with resources and explanations for getting started with open source
*   This is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSl_qnWO104) on making your first pull request on GitHub

GitHub repositories that have lists of projects you can contribute to as a beginner pretty easily: 

*   [List of projects that don't involve coding](http://List of projects that don't involve coding)
*   [Awesome list for beginners](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners/) (sorted by language!)

Learning code: 

*   GitHub has a good collection of free resources to learn different skills and languages and tools [here](https://github.com/collections/learn-to-code) 
*   You can look at this [collection](https://github.com/collections/web-games) on GitHub of people's different kinds of open source games they've made and see how they've built them and get a good idea of how the process works 

Specific to this year (2021): 

*   [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) - it's a month long great big celebration of open source that encourages everyone to contribute however they can, and is a GREAT time to dip your toes in as a beginner—they even have extra guidance JUST for beginners, I'll add them below: 
    *   [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/), which is a site that has a TON of resources for 1) learning about how to contribute and 2) finding easy/beginner issues to try first
    *   [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/), a website that compiles open source tasks that are specifically tagged/labeled as "good for beginners" and want help
    *   [Good First Issues](https://goodfirstissues.com/) does the same thing but with the LATEST ones that pop up on GitHub
    *   [Good First Issue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/) curates them from popular repositories/projects specifically
*   [Game Off](https://gameoff.github.com/) - (this is from November -> December) Making a full modern-style video game at this point is way too complicated for a single person in most circumstances—BUT you can do something like I'll be doing this year, where I'm going to make a simple retro-style text-only game to give me practice with structuring the code and having fun with making a little adventure creatively with whatever crazy stuff I feel like putting into it (and the Game Off has a bunch of resources for all kinds of ways of making games, _including_ making text-only adventures just like that, so if you want to do that too, they have some good resources linked!) 

As far as finding people to help while you're learning—once you start getting involved here and there on GitHub, in Discord servers, on StackExchange, etc., it'll be easier to find people who will be excited to work together with you on things. Don't get discouraged! Your people are out there and you'll be able to find them online even when you sometimes can't irl. It just takes a bit of time and trial and error.  

If you found my post while feeling overwhelmed about joining open source development, hopefully this helped a bit. You're going to be just fine! It's confusing at first, but once you get the hang of things, and find the ways YOU like doing stuff, and the projects YOU enjoy contributing to, you'll find your own groove and start to enjoy it. 

Happy coding!
