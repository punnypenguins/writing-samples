In math lately,
I’ve been learning how to find derivatives
Studying the magic of curves
And now every time I see you,
I find myself calculating
The slope of your smile
The curves of your lips, counting them—
One
Two—
And wondering how it would feel
To set the curves of your mouth
Against the curves of mine
And what the increase
In the area of our hearts
And the decrease
In the volume of our lungs
Would be.
