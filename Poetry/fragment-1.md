*you look the way that sunshine feels in the summer./ I’m writing your name in my journal and scribbling it out in secret/ like a middle schooler in love./ you’re biting into a watermelon slice with laughter on your lips and $3 sunglasses and/ I’m falling more in love with the way/ you turn your thoughts into music for souls/ and the way your toes curl in your flip flops/ when you’re happy and you don’t even know.*
