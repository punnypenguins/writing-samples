First
I reach to pull the stars from the sheets
that I bury myself under,
each night as I sleep.
If the skies are dark enough
the fire in my heart might come back.

Second
I lay on the floor to stare at a hazy
nothing, full of walls and 6a.m. fog.
I stare at my hand
as if that will convince my mind
that I am still here.

Third
I turn steering wheels
just a little too hard,
before the sun comes up.
My mind whispers
that I could find freedom.

Fourth
I walk with strides both measured
and stilting, tipped in caution,
I stare down others
to find a connection that
I am always grasping for.

Fifth
I don’t wake from dreams anymore,
I sleep like marble
and I don’t cry, but if tears come,
they’re the silent kind
and my lungs shake from keeping it in.

Sixth
I have hope
and I keep my wishes locked in
a plastic jar beside my bed, adding up
to the day I find the sun again.
I keep my love

and it will be enough.
