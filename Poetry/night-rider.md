# night rider

the too long sleeves of your old sweatshirt slipping over your fingers,

and your hands slipped over the scuffed up edges of your steering wheel, turning it gently

just-so to the left while you laugh at the song you’re playing from the decade-old radio, and the slivers of streetlight

slip over your hands like brushes of ribbon, like a kiss.

night-rumbles of wheels on a road going somewhere, going somewhere,

anywhere is an adventure to you and you love

taking anyone for the ride.

where are the tattered-sleeve-covered hands

finding their way to tonight? a mystery

you’re singing a new song to, and you’re laughing at the taillights and

got the whole of creation left to solve.
