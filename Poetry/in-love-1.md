I wish that your lips
tasted sweet as apple juice, i wish mine
were soft like a peach.

there’s no romance in a sunrise
unless
you want it to be there.
you know?

you have to make the beauty
in this world.
or rather,
it’s there but you have to look
with a tilted head,
eyes open for a flash of color
in the rain.

we learn to love the red umbrella,
and the way you can still see the stars
in the morning, before the sunrise.

and I learn
to love your lips,
that are quick, and strong, and a little bit tart
at the edges—
and you learn to love mine,
even though they’re chapped,
and slow, and plagued with laughter—

and we learn to love each other
in pieces, one at a time,
and I am unwrapping the gift of you
every day.
