Let me drink the sunlight.

Let me cleanse my body
in light and fire,
until the insides of my lungs
are washed pure,
until the soles of my feet
scatter sparks with every step;

let my heart thrum
liquid gold through my veins,
let the sun burn through my eyes
and my mouth speak light.

Let my body be a temple.
Let me be a love vessel,
a carrier of light,
let me walk
to all the corners of the earth
and light them up.
Let me be incandescent
with the gift of life.

Consume me with the heart of the sun.
I will drink the sunshine;

I want to be radiant.
