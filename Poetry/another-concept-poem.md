# (another) concept poem

scarlet pearls on a chain of sliver,
I’m climbing on the furniture and fast-tap-tap-tapping dress shoes,
I want to love myself
 the way I love my bed with fresh sheets.

I want to climb the tree they tore down when I was twelve I want to read in the crook of its limbs I want to *rewind* like a VHS and erase
everything that came after.
I want to love my skin with its colors and bumps and even its torn bits,
I want to kiss myself back to life where I bleed. Sometimes I wonder if it’s less about fixing myself and more about learning to dance through the pain.

I like sunrises more than sunsets because beginnings mean hope.
I want to tell you everything will be okay
and pull all the kids I see each year that I worry about,
the too-quiet ones, the ones that lash out, the ones that just scream out silently I WANT TO BE LOVED, I want to pull them all close and never let them go.

I want to take the soul of me down to the river,
and wash it clean.

I want to be a tree with roots and arms reaching to the sky for a decade. I wonder what it feels like for a being to trust you *so implicitly* they make a nest for their newborns in your arms.

someday I won’t break the flowers I touch
when I try to show my love for the fine veins of their petals.
I wish I didn’t have to shepherd the kids out of danger because I can see when it’s coming, and take the brunt of it myself.
I’d rather I get it than them,
but the kid in me wishes
none of us got it at all.

I say “I get it” a lot
and I mean I understand your pain and I also would take it for you if I could.
I look at the little ones who are still so trusting, so innocent, so not deserving of a single unkind word, I look and I think *you should be saved.* I wonder how much I made up—I have to be making it up, because otherwise that means what happened
was the *truth.*

I’m already broken and I like to step in front of them
to spare them having the same pain. It’s okay.
It’s okay. I’m *okay.*

I wish someone shielded me. I wish I didn’t know the warning signs. I wish I didn’t have to watch on behalf of the kids at all,
I wish for everything that doesn’t matter because this is what we get.

I have polka dotted bedsheets and they don’t make me feel young, and when people try to tell me that they know it will be better I want to punch them in the face,
because that’s the least helpful thing.
I don’t need to be told “it will get better again someday!” I need you to know
I’m in pain right *now,* I need you to just walk with me through the darkness while it lasts.
*I don’t need a lecture,* I grit out once a week, and it stays true.
These kids don’t need a lecture, they need a hand.
These kids need
to not need a guardian angel.

Lord, save them,
I’ve already lost my graces.
