# I didn’t know what to call this.

I want back all the days I’ll
never get. I want
the life that was stolen
from me
before I knew it was missing.

I lay awake every damn
night this year,
screaming
I didn’t know, I didn’t KNOW
in my silent throat
until
my eyes leak tears I don’t feel the sadness of.

There’s loss,
and then there’s
loss you didn’t know about.

It’s like walking into a room
you used to live in,
and realizing nothing
you can see out the window looks
the same as you remember.

I am pounding on my four walls
grieving for the memories
I am learning I
will never have.
I am screaming out the pain
of a child who wasn’t told she died.
I am sweating blood from
the pores of my worn body,
and looking at my spent soul
as I try to figure out what happened here.
I am picking up pieces
of fear and lonely houses.

I have lost more than I will ever be able to find.
I am grieving the death of a thousand versions of myself.

I am crying into pillows I am
running at dawn to fill my racing heart.
I am carving pain into pages
I am throwing pencils across the room,
and my family asks me why am I so
*angry.*
I don’t know.

All I know is
I have lost
more than I can even understand,
I am *missing.*
I don’t know what I even
missed, but

I feel the ache of it every day.

I live in present and past tense
every moment,
I am chained by my past
and missing my own present, and
what the hell am I supposed
to do about the future?

I’m finding the slots
of missing pieces. I see
my missing parts where others are whole.
I never knew
what losses I carry with me.
It’s countless deaths and
twelve years too late but,
for every good thing I will never
get to feel,
I am learning to grieve.

I am grieving fit to die. I am grieving
every second of every fucking day.
I am learning about
everything that I missed,
and I just want to have it.
I can’t. I know. But
in time, maybe I can find something
new?

I am present-past tense, I am past-present-drowning,
but
I am fighting my way to
acceptance,
and then, maybe,
some sunflowers on my skin and
moving on.
